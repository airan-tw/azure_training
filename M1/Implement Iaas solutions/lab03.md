### Exercise 3: Deploy an Azure container instance

#### Task 1: Enable the admin user in Container Registry

1.  On the Azure portal's **navigation** pane, select the **Resource groups** link.

1.  On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **ContainerCompute** resource group that you created previously in this lab.

1.  On the **ContainerCompute** blade, select the container registry that you created previously in this lab, and then select **Update**.

1.  On the **Update container registry** blade, in the **Admin user** section, select **Enable**.

1.  Select **Save**, and then close the **Update container registry** blade.

#### Task 2: Automatically deploy a container image to an Azure container instance

1.  On the **Container Registry** blade, in the **Services** section, select the **Repositories** link.

1.  In the **Repositories** section, select the **ipcheck** container image repository.

1.  On the **Repository** blade, select the ellipsis menu associated with the **latest** tag entry, and then select **Run instance**.

1.  On the **Create container instance** blade, perform the following actions, and then select **Create**:

    | Setting | Action |
    | -- | -- |
    | **Container name** text box | Enter **managedcompute** |
    | **Container image** text box | Retain the default value |
    | **OS type** section | Select **Linux** |
    | **Subscription** text box | Retain the default value |
    | **Resource group** drop-down list | Select **ContainerCompute** |
    | **Location** drop-down list | Select **East US** |
    | **Number of cores** drop-down list | Select **2** |
    | **Memory (GB)** text box | Enter **4** |
    | **Public IP address** section | Select **No** |

    The following screenshot displays the configured settings on the **Create container instance** blade.

    > **Note**: Wait for the container instance to be created before you continue with this lab.

#### Task 3: Manually deploy a container image to Container Instances

1.  On the Azure portal's **navigation** pane, select the **Create a resource** link.

1.  On the **Create a resource** blade, in the **Search services and marketplace** text box, enter **container instances**, and then select Enter.

1.  On the **Marketplace** search results blade, select the **Container Instances** result.

1.  On the **Container Instances** blade, select **Create**.

1.  On the **Create Container Instance** blade, on the **Basics** tab, perform the following actions, and then select **Review + create**:

       | Setting | Action |
       | -- | -- |
       | **Subscription** drop-down list | Retain the default value |
       | **Resource group** drop-down list | Select **ContainerCompute** |
       | **Container name**Â text box | Enter **manualcompute** |
       | **Region** drop-down list | Select **(US) East US** |
       | **Image source** section | Select **Azure Container Registry** |
       | **Registry** drop-down list | Select the **Azure Container Registry** resource that you created previously in this lab |
       | **Image** drop-down list | Select **ipcheck** |
       | **Image tag** drop-down list | Select **latest** |

       The following screenshot displays the configured settings on the **Create container instance** blade.

       ![Create container instance blade](./media/l05_create_container_instance_manual.png)

1.  From the **Review + create** tab, review the selected options.

1.  Select **Create** to create the container instance by using your specified configuration.  

    > **Note**: Wait for the container instance to be created before you continue with this lab.

#### Task 4: Validate that the container instance ran successfully

1.  On the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Resource groups** link.

1.  On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **ContainerCompute** resource group that you created previously in this lab.

1.  On the **ContainerCompute** blade, select the **manualcompute** container instance that you created previously in this lab.

1.  On the **Container Instances** blade, in the **Settings** section, select the **Containers** link.

1.  In the **Containers** section, review the list of **Events**.

1.  Select the **Logs** tab, and then review the text logs from the container instance.

> **Note**: You can also optionally find the **Events** and **Logs** from the **managedcompute** container instance.

> **Note**: It is possible that **manualcompute** and **managedcompute** will not contain any events at this point.

> **Note**: After the application finishes running, the container terminates because it has completed its work. For the manually created container instance, you indicated that a successful exit was acceptable, so the container ran once. The automatically created instance didn't offer this option, and it assumes the container should always be running, so you'll notice repeated restarts of the container.

#### Review

In this exercise, you used multiple methods to deploy a container image to an Azure container instance. By using the manual method, you were able to customize the deployment further and to run task-based applications as part of a container run.

### Exercise 4: Clean up your subscription

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1.  In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon ![Cloud Shell icon](./media/az204_lab_CloudShell.png) to open a new Bash session. If Cloud Shell defaults to a PowerShell session, select **PowerShell**, and then in the drop-down menu, select **Bash**.

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you're starting **Cloud Shell**, when prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. When you're presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you're using in this lab, and then select **Create storage**.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  On the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to delete the **ContainerCompute** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name ContainerCompute --no-wait --yes
    ```

   > **Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the *--no-wait* parameter), so while you'll be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it'll take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane in the portal.

#### Task 3: Close the active applications

-   Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource groups used in this lab.

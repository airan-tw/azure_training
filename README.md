# Azure Journey - Learning Experience.

## Welcome

This repository is for training developers based on the content of the course AZ-204: Developing solutions for Microsoft Azure.

The objective of this course is to teach developers how to create end-to-end solutions in Microsoft Azure. Students will learn how to implement Azure compute solutions, create Azure Functions, implement and manage web apps, develop solutions utilizing Azure storage, implement authentication and authorization, and secure their solutions by using KeyVault and Managed Identities. Students will also learn how to connect to and consume Azure services and third-party services, and include event- and message-based models in their solutions. The course also covers monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing Azure solutions.

## Requirements
